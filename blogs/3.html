                            <p>If you chance upon every second person in a crowd, you can definitely hear their best
                                past-time to be reading. It’s definitely not surprising, but every individual has an
                                innate quality to consume information through reading. For some, it’s a pleasure, for a
                                few it’s cumbersome, and for the rest it’s a mandate. While it’s not necessarily a
                                qualification for product folks to inculcate the habit of reading, the ones who do it
                                don’t go without returns.</p>

                            <p>With a bevy of well-known books written for anyone who wants to kickstart or ascend in a
                                product career, including UI/UX design, product marketing, product management,
                                development, and more, here's contrary to the obvious—the least-expected books that can
                                actually relate to product-building and launching!&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>While these four may be hard-core business, leadership, or memoir books, there are some
                                top lessons every product-centric person can pick from these.</p>

                            <p>Let’s look at the run-through:</p>

                            <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30835567-hit-refresh"
                                    target="blank"><strong>Hit Refresh</strong></a></p>

                            <p>One of the most-famous releases in 2017 is ‘Hit Refresh’ by Satya Nadella, the CEO of
                                Microsoft Corporation. In one word, this book can be called MAGIC. Bringing in a
                                grounded and valuable perspective from Nadella, there’s a deep discussion on
                                opportunities created by technology, the human-tech relationships, progression and the
                                future of the world. From what turned out as the biggest blow to Microsoft, this piece
                                by Nadella describes what the company did to grow past its failures and emerge as the
                                most-trusted and empathetic brand of today’s times.</p>

                            <p>One of the prime <em>(and obvious) </em>reasons to pick this up is to master (or atleast
                                get exposed to) business strategy. The what-why-how cycle is well explained with every
                                note. As for product folks, there are two underlying thoughts that are very
                                transformational:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Empathy is the king in a disruptive and progressive tech world. As product makers
                                    and professionals, one of the key concepts that we need to understand is who we’re
                                    building products for and why. Leaving behind personal apprehensions, what matters
                                    more is how empathetic and responsive we are to existing concerns and needs of the
                                    growing customer population. Where there’s necessity, there’s market, hence birth
                                    meaningful products.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>The ability to constantly rediscover and reinitiate the purpose, what Nadella
                                    beautifully calls as raison d'être of an organization. Now, let’s apply this to the
                                    products we handle. How helpful would it be if we as teams reinstate and analyze to
                                    discover the “why” behind our operations! The vision of products lies not just in
                                    what the company states in papers but the collective thoughts and purpose for which
                                    the product was introduced in the first place.&nbsp;</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16071764-lean-in"
                                    target="blank"><strong>Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead</strong></a></p>

                            <p>This classic from Sheryl Sandberg is something that any assertive and ambitious leader
                                would love to pick. Apart from the bold and groundbreaking lessons this book imparts in
                                every woman (and man), there’s even appreciative product thoughts this book leaves
                                behind:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Sense of community is an oft-quoted yet not-oft-practiced concept. In today’s
                                    product environment, building a community has become mainstream. Collecting people,
                                    forming a medium, and propagating messages have by far been the easiest of tasks,
                                    thanks to the rapidly-growing technology. What has perhaps taken the most-difficult
                                    title is the impact and the motive behind forming a community. A community of
                                    like-minded product individuals, a community of customers, a community of tech
                                    leaders—there’s no dearth to forming a clan. But, where we have to seal the lack is
                                    understanding the purpose of existence and encouraging members of the community to
                                    strive for bigger and better, together.</li>
                                <li>Raising opinions and ideas around every product decision. It’s easy to get a nod
                                    from a room full of folks; the only difficult thing is to tackle a denial. A product
                                    team where there’s acceptance from everyone in the long run turns into a room of
                                    plaintive minders. This doesn’t mean people need to be naysayers. Instead, what’s
                                    required is calculative criticism, bold candidness, and the ability to oppose
                                    decisions with validation. What dominates should be clarity of thoughts and not
                                    extreme misogynism, ego, or jealousy.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck"
                                    target="blank"><strong>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</strong></a></p>

                            <p>This counterintuitive approach to life by Mark Manson is like eating ice cream in
                                winters—as farcical as it sounds, it has a deeper meaning and a methodology. Anything
                                but a dud, this book is what every reader picks up for some soulful, non-fictive read.
                                What product lessons can we find here, you ask? Here are the gems for you:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Flawed is fine. Accepting one’s inferiorities and addressing self limitations can
                                    seem depressing but rewarding. Why? Let’s apply this to our product world. It’s no
                                    longer going to help when all’s good in the products we market. Nor does it help to
                                    mask a poorly-functioning product and faking it to be a stable fit. What’s instead
                                    needed is acceptance that the product needs periodic enhancement and embrace the
                                    current failures that the product teams endure. Likewise, giving room to constant
                                    feedback from customers erases the delusionally high and sabotaging thought-web we
                                    create for putting down our own products.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>In life, it’s better to follow the limited-f*ck mechanism—mind only what matters out
                                    of your adversities. Don’t you think this helps great with fixing and fine-tuning
                                    products for the market? When there are hundreds of requests and features to be
                                    handled, minding what matters more in terms of impact and future revenue road-map
                                    instead of trying to be happy aka adopting every little suggestion is savvy. This
                                    doesn’t mean you’re <em>mediocre</em>; instead, you become a <em>mindful</em>
                                    product leader.&nbsp;</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air"
                                    target="blank"><strong>When breath becomes air</strong></a></p>

                            <p>One of the beautiful and heart-wrenching memoirs written by an ailing surgeon, Paul
                                Kalanithi, this book is like a zephyr that vanishes, leaving you with lingering
                                thoughts. From addressing what makes life worth living at the verge of dying to battling
                                with the uncertainty of an ephemeral future, Paul’s writing teaches you to appreciate
                                your miraculous life.</p>

                            <p>What Paul imparts in us, the product people, is very subtle—the perseverance and will to
                                look beyond deadlocks and logjams. Seeming to be morbid to our product growth-map, there
                                are things beyond even a founder or manager’s control. How to handle situations wherein
                                your product team is collapsed or taken over by someone? What to do when your GTM
                                strategy gets misled? What happens when an IPO fails, or say, your VCs don’t get their
                                returns from your startup? The list of deadly moments can be numerous, and as Paul
                                states in his memoir, “You can’t go on. You’ll go on.” <em>(read in first person!)</em>
                            </p>

                            <p>Go on and cross every barrier in your product career, for all you need is the acceptance
                                of reality and the willingness to start over, every time you fall.</p>

                            <p>And, little was the realization that these four books from different genres could tie
                                together to speak volumes about focusing on product-thinking and building meaningful
                                products for the world!</p>
